# CLIforGroupMe
A command line interface for GroupMe that utilizes curses.

################################

This program was created as a way for me to test the curses library in python. The process was simple enough that I started to flesh it out. If you are looking for a starting point in curses, I recommend a chat app like this.

Future updates (if there are any) will include:
  Colored names for group members.
  Real time terminal size adjustment (currently crashes if this is done).
  Text wrapping (formatting is wonky on long messages).
  Support for direct messages.
  "Pop-Ups" for when new messages are found in a chat.
